# SDG_7_Predict_renewable_energy_gen_
United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG) focuses on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. As the world moves towards renewable energy sources, there is a need to optimize energy distribution and consumption through smart grids. 

This is a web application that predicts renewable energy generation (e.g., solar, wind, hydro) and optimizes energy distribution in a smart grid system. The solution leverages machine learning algorithms to analyse historical data, weather patterns, and other relevant factors to provide accurate and timely predictions of renewable energy generation.
 
The application also helps utilities and end-users optimize their energy consumption, based on renewable energy availability and real-time demand. Additionally, the solution promotes awareness of clean energy initiatives, encouraging users to adopt sustainable energy practices and reduce their environmental impact.
