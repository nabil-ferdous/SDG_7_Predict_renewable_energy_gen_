# SDG_7_Predict_renewable_energy_gen_
Web application that predicts renewable energy generation (e.g., solar, wind, hydro) and optimizes energy distribution in a smart grid system. The solution leverages machine learning algorithms to analyse historical data, weather patterns, and other relevant factors to provide accurate and timely predictions of renewable energy generation.
